Description:
------------
An implementation of a deep learning recommendation model (DLRM)
The model input consists of dense and sparse features. The former is a vector
of floating point values. The latter is a list of sparse indices into
embedding tables, which consist of vectors of floating point values.
The selected vectors are passed to mlp networks denoted by triangles,
in some cases the vectors are interacted through operators (Ops).
```
output:
                    probability of a click

  /__\                      /__\           ...      /__\
   |                          |                       |
   |                         Op                      Op
   |                    ____/__\_____           ____/__\____
   |                   |_Emb_|____|__|    ...  |_Emb_|__|___|
input:
[ dense features ]     [sparse indices] , ..., [sparse indices]
```
 More precise definition of model layers:
 1) fully connected layers of an mlp

    z = f(y)

    y = Wx + b

 2) embedding lookup (for a list of sparse indices p=[p1,...,pk])

    z = Op(e1,...,ek)

    obtain vectors e1=E[:,p1], ..., ek=E[:,pk]

 3) Operator Op can be one of the following

    Sum(e1,...,ek) = e1 + ... + ek

    Dot(e1,...,ek) = [e1'e1, ..., e1'ek, ..., ek'e1, ..., ek'ek]

    Cat(e1,...,ek) = [e1', ..., ek']'

    where ' denotes transpose operation

Testing
-------
Testing scripts to confirm functional correctness of the code
```
./test/dlrm_s_test.sh
Running commands ...
python dlrm_s_pytorch.py
python dlrm_s_caffe2.py
Checking results ...
diff test1 (no numeric values in the output = SUCCESS)
diff test2 (no numeric values in the output = SUCCESS)
diff test3 (no numeric values in the output = SUCCESS)
diff test4 (no numeric values in the output = SUCCESS)
```

*NOTE: Testing scripts accept extra arguments which will be passed along to the model, such as --use-gpu*

Benchmarking
------------
1) Performance benchmarking
    ```
    ./bench/dlrm_s_benchmark.sh
    ```

2) The code supports interface with the [Criteo Kaggle Display Advertising Challenge Dataset](https://labs.criteo.com/2014/02/kaggle-display-advertising-challenge-dataset/).
   - Please do the following to prepare the dataset for use with DLRM code:
     - First, specify the raw data file (train.txt) as downloaded with --raw-data-file=<path/train.txt>
     - This is then pre-processed (categorize, concat across days...) to allow using with dlrm code
     - The processed data is stored as *.npz file in <root_dir>/input/*.npz
     - The processed file (*.npz) can be used for subsequent runs with --processed-data-file=<path/*.npz>
   - The model can be trained using the following script
     ```
     ./bench/dlrm_s_criteo_kaggle.sh [--test-freq=1024]
     ```

<img src="./kaggle_dac_loss_accuracy_plots.png" width="900" height="320">

3) The code supports interface with the [Criteo Terabyte Dataset](https://labs.criteo.com/2013/12/download-terabyte-click-logs/).
   - Please do the following to prepare the dataset for use with DLRM code:
     - First, download the raw data files day_0.gz, ...,day_23.gz and unzip them
     - Specify the location of the unzipped text files day_0, ...,day_23, using --raw-data-file=<path/day> (the day number will be appended automatically)
     - These are then pre-processed (categorize, concat across days...) to allow using with dlrm code
     - The processed data is stored as *.npz file in <root_dir>/input/*.npz
     - The processed file (*.npz) can be used for subsequent runs with --processed-data-file=<path/*.npz>
   - The model can be trained using the following script
    ```
      ./bench/dlrm_s_criteo_terabyte.sh ["--test-freq=10240 --memory-map --data-sub-sample-rate=0.875"]
    ```

    [dlrm_emb64_subsample0.875_maxindrange10M_pretrained.pt](https://dlrm.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/models/tb0875_10M.pt)

<img src="./terabyte_0875_loss_accuracy_plots.png" width="900" height="320">

*NOTE: Benchmarking scripts accept extra arguments which will be passed along to the model, such as --num-batches=100 to limit the number of data samples*

4) The code supports interface with [MLPerf benchmark](https://mlperf.org).
   - Please refer to the following training parameters
   ```
     --mlperf-logging that keeps track of multiple metrics, including area under the curve (AUC)

     --mlperf-acc-threshold that allows early stopping based on accuracy metric

     --mlperf-auc-threshold that allows early stopping based on AUC metric

     --mlperf-bin-loader that enables preprocessing of data into a single binary file

     --mlperf-bin-shuffle that controls whether a random shuffle of mini-batches is performed
   ```
   - The MLPerf training model is completely specified and can be trained using the following script
   ```
     ./bench/run_and_time.sh [--use-gpu]
   ```
   - Corresponding pre-trained model is available under [CC-BY-NC license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/) and can be downloaded here
     [dlrm_emb128_subsample0.0_maxindrange40M_pretrained.pt](https://dlrm.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/models/tb00_40M.pt)

Model checkpoint saving/loading
-------------------------------
During training, the model can be saved using --save-model=<path/model.pt>

The model is saved if there is an improvement in test accuracy (which is checked at --test-freq intervals).

A previously saved model can be loaded using --load-model=<path/model.pt>

Once loaded the model can be used to continue training, with the saved model being a checkpoint.
Alternatively, the saved model can be used to evaluate only on the test data-set by specifying --inference-only option.
